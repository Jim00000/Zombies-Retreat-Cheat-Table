# Zombies-Retreat-Cheat-Table

Visit https://sirensdomain.itch.io/zombiesretreat for more game information <br/>
Notice that this cheat table only supports Cheat Engine 7.0 or above

# Cheat Table Content

- (HotKey : NUM1) Make current equipment ... (infinite ammo if the equipment is pistol, infinite Herb, etc.). Press "Q" key to make value change
- (HotKey : NUM2) Get all of items x90 (See Note 1)
- (HotKey : NUM3) Set held items x90 (See Note 1)

## Note 1

I found out that this game sometimes crashes while the cheat is activated. To avoid game crash, activate the cheat while the game menu is open and deactivate the cheat before leaving the game menu. Be sure to click "Item" entry in the game menu to make cheat take effect.

## Caveat

"Get all of items x90" cheat will make game crash or freeze. It is not recommended to use.

# How to select correct process

"File" -> "Open Process" to open "Process List" windows. Click "Processes" tab, You will see list like "000004AC - svchost.exe". There are four processes likes "00001CF0-Zombie's Retreat - Beta x.xx.x.exe". Only one process is actually that our cheat takes effect. But which one ? You can use speedhack (there is a "Enable speedhack" checkbox) to check which process autually got influenced and that's what we want.
